	abstract = {The treatment of melanoma has been revolutionised in recent years by advances in the understanding of the genomic landscape of this disease, which has led to the development of new targeted therapeutic agents, and the ability to therapeutically manipulate the immune system through inhibition of cancer cell-T-cell interactions that prevent an adaptive immune response. While these therapeutic interventions have dramatically improved the prospects of survival for patients with advanced melanoma, they bring significant complexity to the interpretation of therapeutic response because their mechanisms and temporal profile of response vary considerably. In this review, we discuss the mode of action of these emerging therapies and their toxicities to provide a framework for the use of FDG PET/CT in therapeutic response assessment. We propose that the greatest utility of PET in assessment of response to agents that abrogate signalling related to BRAF mutation is for early assessment of resistance, while in anti-CTLA4 therapy, immunological flare can compromise early assessment of response but can identify potentially life-threatening autoimmune reactions. For anti-PD1/ PDL1 therapy, the role of FDG PET/CT is more akin to its use in other solid malignancies undergoing treatment with conventional chemotherapy. However, further research is required to optimise the timing of scans and response criteria in this disease.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ymeth.2020.11.005},
	abstract = {Background: Systemic therapy agents targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for use since 2011. This type of therapy aims to trigger a patient’s immune response to attack tumor cells, rather than acting against the tumor directly. Radiomics is an automated method of medical image analysis that is now being actively investigated for predictive markers of treatment response in immunotherapy.
Objective: To conduct an early systematic review determining the current status of radiomic features as potential predictive markers of immunotherapy response. Provide a detailed critical appraisal of methodological quality of models, as this informs the degree of confidence about current reports of model performance. In addition, to offer some recommendations for future studies that could establish robust evidence for radiomic features as immu­ notherapy response markers.
Method: A PubMed citation search was conducted for publications up to and including April 2020, followed by full-text screening. A total of seven articles meeting the eligibility criteria were examined in detail for study characteristics, model information and methodological quality. The review was conducted in the Cochrane style but has not been prospectively registered. Results are reported following Preferred Reporting Items for Sys­ tematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA) guidelines.
Results: A total of seven studies were examined in detail, comprising non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic melanoma and a diverse assortment of solid tumors. Methodological robustness of reviewed studies varied greatly. Principal shortcomings were lack of prospective registration, and deficiencies in feature selection and dimensionality reduction, model calibration, clinical utility and external validation. A few studies with overall moderate to good methodological quality were identified. These results suggest that current state-of-the-art performance of radiomics in regards to discrimination (area under the curve or concordance index) is in the vicinity of 0.7, but the very small number of studies to date prevents any conclusive remarks to be made. We recommended future improvements in regards to prospective study registration, clinical utility, methodological procedure and data sharing.
Conclusions: Radiomics has a potentially significant role for predicting immunotherapy response. Additional multi-institutional studies with robust methodological underpinning and repeated external validations are required to establish the (added) value of radiomics within the pantheon of clinical tools for decision-making in immunotherapy.},

Biomedical networks are universal descriptors of systems of interacting elements, from protein interactions to disease networks, all the way to healthcare systems and scientific knowledge. In this review, we put forward an observation that long-standing principles of network biology and medicine -- while often unspoken in machine learning research -- can provide the conceptual grounding for representation learning, explain its current successes and limitations, and inform future advances. We synthesize a spectrum of algorithmic approaches that, at their core, leverage topological features to embed networks into compact vector spaces. We also provide a taxonomy of biomedical areas that are likely to benefit most from algorithmic innovation. Representation learning techniques are becoming essential for identifying causal variants underlying complex traits, disentangling behaviors of single cells and their impact on health, and diagnosing and treating diseases with safe and effective medicines.},

Therefore, more and more attention has been paid to the identification and development of predictive biomarkers for the response of ICIs, and more in-depth and comprehensive understanding has been continuously explored in recent years. Predictive markers of ICIs efficacy have been gradually explored from the expression of intermolecular interactions within tumor cells to the expression of various molecules and cells in tumor microenvironment, and been extended to the exploration of circulating and host systemic markers. With the development of high-throughput sequencing and microarray technology, a variety of biomarker strategies have been deeply explored and gradually achieved the process from the identification of single marker to the development of multifactorial synergistic predictive markers. Comprehensive predictive-models developed by integrating different types of data based on different components of tumor-host interactions is the direction of future research and will have a profound impact in the field of precision immuno-oncology. In this review, we deeply analyze the exploration course and research progress of predictive biomarkers as an adjunctive tool to tumor immunotherapy in effectively identifying the efficacy of ICIs, and discuss their future directions in achieving precision immuno-oncology.},

	abstract = {Learning from unordered sets is a fundamental learning setup, recently attracting increasing attention. Research in this area has focused on the case where elements of the set are represented by feature vectors, and far less emphasis has been given to the common case where set elements themselves adhere to their own symmetries. That case is relevant to numerous applications, from deblurring image bursts to multi-view 3D shape recognition and reconstruction. In this paper, we present a principled approach to learning sets of general symmetric elements. We first characterize the space of linear layers that are equivariant both to element reordering and to the inherent symmetries of elements, like translation in the case of images. We further show that networks that are composed of these layers, called Deep Sets for Symmetric Elements (DSS) layers, are universal approximators of both invariant and equivariant functions, and that these networks are strictly more expressive than Siamese networks. DSS layers are also straightforward to implement. Finally, we show that they improve over existing set-learning architectures in a series of experiments with images, graphs, and point-clouds.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            A wide range of cancer immunotherapy approaches has been developed including non-specific immune-stimulants such as cytokines, cancer vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and adoptive T cell therapy. Among them, ICIs are the most commonly used and intensively studied. Since 2011, these drugs have received marketing authorisation for melanoma, lung, bladder, renal, and head and neck cancers, with remarkable and long-lasting treatment response in some patients. The novel mechanism of action of ICIs, with immune and T cell activation, leads to unusual patterns of response on imaging, with the advent of so-called pseudoprogression being more pronounced and frequently observed when compared to other anticancer therapies. Pseudoprogression, described in about 2–10\% of patients treated with ICIs, corresponds to an increase of tumour burden and/or the appearance of new lesions due to infiltration by activated T cells before the disease responds to therapy. To overcome the limitation of response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) to assess these specific changes, new imaging criteria—so-called immune-related response criteria and then immune-related RECIST (irRECIST)—were proposed. The major modification involved the inclusion of the measurements of new target lesions into disease assessments and the need for a 4-week re-assessment to confirm or not confirm progression. The RECIST working group introduced the new concept of “unconfirmed progression”, into the irRECIST. This paper reviews current immunotherapeutic approaches and summarises radiologic criteria to evaluate new patterns of response to immunotherapy. Furthermore, imaging features of immunotherapy-related adverse events and available predictive biomarkers of response are presented.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00121},
	abstract = {Spatial-temporal graph modeling is an important task to analyze the spatial relations and temporal trends of components in a system. Existing approaches mostly capture the spatial dependency on a fixed graph structure, assuming that the underlying relation between entities is pre-determined. However, the explicit graph structure (relation) does not necessarily reflect the true dependency and genuine relation may be missing due to the incomplete connections in the data. Furthermore, existing methods are ineffective to capture the temporal trends as the RNNs or CNNs employed in these methods cannot capture long-range temporal sequences. To overcome these limitations, we propose in this paper a novel graph neural network architecture, Graph WaveNet, for spatial-temporal graph modeling. By developing a novel adaptive dependency matrix and learn it through node embedding, our model can precisely capture the hidden spatial dependency in the data. With a stacked dilated 1D convolution component whose receptive field grows exponentially as the number of layers increases, Graph WaveNet is able to handle very long sequences. These two components are integrated seamlessly in a unified framework and the whole framework is learned in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on two public traffic network datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm.},

In particular, checkpoint inhibition has shown to increase long-term outcome, and, in some cases, it can be virtually curative. However, the absence of clinically validated predictive biomarkers is one of the major causes of unpredictable efficacy of immunotherapy. Indeed, the availability of predictive biomarkers could allow a better stratification of patients, suggesting which type of drugs should be used in a certain clinical context and guiding clinicians in escalating or de-escalating therapy. However, the difficulty in obtaining clinically useful predictive biomarkers reflects the deep complexity of tumor biology. Biomarkers can be classified as tumor-intrinsic biomarkers, microenvironment biomarkers, and systemic biomarkers. Herein we review the available literature to classify and describe predictive biomarkers for checkpoint inhibition in melanoma with the aim of helping clinicians in the decision-making process.
