# Graph analytics for immunotherapeutic response prediction for metastatic melanoma patients

###### Semester project in LTS4, autumn 2021

## Structure

### EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

A semi-interactive dashboard was developed with Streamlit in `eda.py`. To launch it, run the following command from the base directory:

```bash
streamlit run src/eda.py -- --data DATA_DIR
```

### models

The models package contains all the models evaluated during the course of this project.

### notebooks

Some notebooks have been added as they were used to generate plots. They are not essential but remain in our submission for completeness.
